#every linux bash command or function has the same structure
#which is :
#command -option target
cal #shows me a graphical calendar
date #also shows the date in txt format
df -h #tells me the size of the files located in the cwd
wc -l <filename>  #tells me the number of lines of a file, why does it always tells me n_lines -1?

#<> replaces means that the file especification does not require ''
#we are adding some new lines just to check that this is working correctly


#Now again we are adding some new lines just to see if this is the new head of our branch
