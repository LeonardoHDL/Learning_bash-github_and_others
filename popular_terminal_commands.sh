#every linux bash command or function has the same structure
#which is :
#command -option target
cal #shows me a graphical calendar
date #also shows the date in txt format
df -h #tells me the size of the files located in the cwd
wc -l #tell me the number of lines of a file, why does it always tells me n_lines -1?
