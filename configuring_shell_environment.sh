#you can put a configuration file everytime 
#you log into a computer or a cluster so
#so you can access to everything with the configs
#that you have developed
 

#there's a form so that we can store things
#on variables , and the call them directly from the
#CLI
#this is with the command export
export trial='2134141'
#and for to print it i'd like 
echo $trial

#the idea behind this is that we can use
#the same thing on our bashrc file so we can acces
#anytime
